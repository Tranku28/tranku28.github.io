            <h4>FotoGraf</h4>
            <p>A 3D game created during the RE-use Game Jam, in which you play as a street photographer who is late with paying your apartment rent. To earn money, you must take as many photos as possible in a short time while avoiding oncoming cars.</p>

            <h4>AbyssalTides</h4>
            <p>A 2D game where you play as a small octopus trying to escape from a crashed ship. The game features several levels, each with a variety of puzzles that you must solve by playing mini-games, navigating hazards, and collecting useful items. The player has eight inventory slots for items, but if the octopus loses a tentacle, the space shrinks and the player's movements slow down.</p>
